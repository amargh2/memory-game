------------------------- Memory Game ------------------------

This is a memory game built with React hooks and styled with Tailwind CSS.

To play: click every picture only once; if you click the same picture more than once, the game starts over and the score resets to zero. 

Learning/reflections from me: hooks feel a lot better to write than classes, though I can't say why for sure. In general, React feels like magic to use, especially after having built quite a few projects with vanilla JS and plain old DOM manipulation. This would have taken me much longer to make without the framework.
